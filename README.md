# üìä **Data Warehouse Project**

## üìù **Project Overview**

This project involves building a **Modern Data Warehouse** using the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers). The tasks include:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Data Warehouse with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Requirements**

### **Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)**

#### üéØ **Objective**
Develop a **Modern Data Warehouse** using PostgreSQL to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### üìù **Specifications**
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues before analysis.
- **Integration**: Merge both datasets into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus only on the latest dataset; historization of data is not required.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Data Architecture**

The Data Warehouse design follows the **Medallion Architecture** with three main layers:

### 1. **Bronze Layer**
- Stores **raw** data exactly as it comes from the source systems (CSV files to PostgreSQL).

### 2. **Silver Layer**
- Data undergoes **cleaning**, **normalization**, and **standardization** to prepare it for analysis.

### 3. **Gold Layer**
- Stores **business-ready** data in a **star schema** format, optimized for reporting and analytics.
